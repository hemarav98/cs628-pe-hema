# MyResume Web App

## Input
There is a limited number of inputs in this web application since most of the information is defined the resume.js file thus no extra information is needed after compilation. 


## Process
The web app follows these steps to create the resume:

1. Rendering the Resume Container: The main container is initialized, which holds the entire resume content.

2. Displaying the Header: The header section shows the person's name and contact information.

3. Finally, it presents Education, Skills, Work Experience, and Projects: Each section is rendered sequentially. The education section includes degree, university name, and graduation date. The skills section lists programming languages, frameworks, libraries, database systems, operating systems, and version control tools. The work experience section displays job positions, company names, employment durations, and job responsibilities. The projects section provides project names with links to their source code repositories.

## Output
The web app generates a visually appealing and well-organized resume. It showcases the person's information, education, skills, work experience, and projects. Each section is structured with clear headings and relevant content. It also offers a user-friendly interface, allowing easy navigation through different resume sections. The background color of the resume page is set to a pleasant shade of rgba(#bdfb04). Notably, the text color remains black to ensure readability. The margins and fonts were also adjusted to match the desired style, as shown in the provided sample image.
