## Input

The input for the program consists of an array of movie objects, each containing properties such as title, genre, and release year. Additionally, the user can select a genre from a dropdown menu to filter the movies based on the selected genre.

## Process

The program uses React and hooks to manage the state of the selected genre and the movie list. The list of movies is rendered dynamically based on the selected genre. When the user clicks on a movie, an alert is displayed with the movie title. Finally, it also dynamically generates the dropdown select element with unique genres extracted from the movie list.

## Output

The program displayes a movie list on a webpage. The list includes the movie title, genre, and release year for each movie. The movies are rendered on separate cards. When the user selects a genre from the dropdown, the program filters the movies based on the selected genre and displays only the movies that match the selected genre. If the user selects "All Genres" from the dropdown, all the movies are displayed.
