# Input

The Recipe Finder application operates based on a user's input of recipe data. Users provide recipe information, including the recipe name, list of ingredients, and cooking instructions. This input is then processed by the application to store, update, and display the recipe details.

# Process

The application processes the user's input by utilizing a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The frontend, developed using React, collects user inputs through forms and buttons. Upon submission, the data is sent to the backend, which is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend processes the data, performing operations such as adding, updating, and deleting recipes in the MongoDB database.

# Output

The output of the Recipe Finder application is the presentation of recipe information to the user. When a user accesses the recipe list, the frontend fetches data from the backend and displays it in an organized manner. Clicking on a recipe's name reveals detailed information, while edit and delete options provide interactivity. The application communicates effectively between frontend and backend, resulting in a seamless presentation of recipe data to the user.
